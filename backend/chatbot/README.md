# Chatbot Module

This folder will contain the logic for the free, local chatbot to answer questions about Tunisian fiscal rules and tax calculations. The chatbot will be built using an open-source framework (e.g., Rasa or Botpress) and will be integrated with the backend.

## Next Steps

- Add intents and responses for fiscal laws and tax calculations.
- Optionally connect to backend logic for dynamic calculations.
- Prepare a knowledge base or FAQ dataset about Tunisian fiscal rules.
- Enhance with open-source NLP for better understanding.
